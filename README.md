# PrivateWork
All my private work will be listed here


## My biggest plugins

### !ws, !market, !roulette/!roleta & !bank
Skins must be unlocked with the !roulette/roleta and only then they can be equipped with !ws.
Players can also buy and sell skins with !market using credits from the Bank.
Use !bank 500 to deposit 500 credits in the bank or !bank -500 to withdraw 500 credits from the bank

### VIPMenu
This vipmenu is different. It works with any game mode because you can disable or enable specific features. It's highly configurable.
Includes VIPSpawn and a VIPMenu with weapons, medkit, wh grenade and Rocket Jump. One of the best things about it is that is resuable. That means that you can reopen the menu mid-round or vipspawn right after joining the server

## WIP (Work In Progress)
### CodeRewards
Code rewards is a simple plugin but can be really useful for communities with partnerships. Admins can use !setcode to create a code, for example, an Youtuber name.
Then the player does !code <youtuber> to get a reward.
  
### ReferralRewards
Very similar to CodeRewards but all players can create their codes. Then they give the code to a friend and that friend gets credits. The inviter also gets a bonus when their friend gets VIP or Buys anything from the server.

### PowerUP
PowerUP is different. It's a progression-based plugin, like an RPG. Every action you do counts. You did damage to someone, get EXP; you killed someone, even more EXP. 
When you get enough EXP you Level Up. You also get PowerUP-specific credits that can used to unlock thing such as VIP, Tags, etc.
